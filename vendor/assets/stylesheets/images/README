Folder /vendor/assets/stylesheets/images moved to /app/assets/images/panorama/images
because Jetty wants to load vendor's images by http://....assets/panorama/images/*.* in production mode

For function with webbrick in development mode this folder is also linked from  /vendor/assets/stylesheets/images
